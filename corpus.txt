Voila! Finally, the Pirates Of The Caribbean script is here for all you quotes spouting fans of the Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley movie. This script is a transcript that was painstakingly transcribed using the screenplay and/or viewings of Pirates Of The Caribbean. I know, I know, I still need to get the cast names in there and I'll be eternally tweaking it, so if you have any corrections, feel free to drop me a line. You won't hurt my feelings. Honest.
 Drink up, me hearties, yo ho We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot Drink up, me hearties, yo ho A pirate's life for me We extort, we pilfer, we filch and sack Drink up Quiet, missy. Cursed pirates sail these waters. You don't want to bring them . Mr. Gibbs, that will do. She was singing about pirates. lt's bad luck to be singing about pirates with us mired in this unnatural fog . Mark my words. Consider them marked . On your way. Aye, Lieutenant. lt's bad luck to have a woman on board , too. Even a miniature one. l think it'd be rather exciting to meet a pirate. Think again , Miss Swann . Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them . l intend that any man who sails under a pirate flag or wears a pirate brand gets what he deserves. A short drop and a sudden stop. Lieutenant Norrington , l appreciate your fervor, but l'm concerned about the effect this subject will have upon my daughter. My apologies, Governor Swann . Actually, l find it all fascinating . Yes. That's what concerns me. Look! A boy! There's a boy in the water! Man overboard ! Man the ropes. Fetch a hook. Haul him aboard . He's still breathing . Mary, Mother of God . What happened here? lt's the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed . A lot of good it did them . Everyone's thinking it. l'm just saying it. Pirates. There's no proof of that. lt's probably an accident. Rouse the captain immediately. Heave to and take in sail . Launch the boats. Elizabeth , l want you to accompany the boy. He'll be in your charge. Take care of him . lt's okay. My name's Elizabeth Swann . Will Turner. l'm watching over you , Will . You're a pirate. Has he said anything? His name's William Turner. That's all l found out. Take him below. Are you all right? Are you decent? Yes. Yes. Still abed at this hour? Oh , it's a beautiful day. l have a gift for you . Oh , it's beautiful . lsn't it? May l inquire as to the occasion? Does a father need an occasion to dote upon his daughter? Go on . Actually, l . . . l hoped you might wear it for the ceremony today. The ceremony? Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony. l knew it. Commodore Norrington , as he's about to become. A fine gentleman , don't you think? He fancies you , you know. How's it coming? lt's difficult to say. l'm told it's the latest fashion in London . Well , women in London must've learnt not to breathe. Milord , you have a visitor. Mr. Turner. Good to see you again . Good day, sir. l have your order. Well . The blade is folded steel . That's gold filigree laid into the handle. lf l may. Perfectly balanced . The tang is nearly the full width of the blade. lmpressive. Very impressive. Now, now. Commodore Norrington is going to be very pleased with this. Do pass my compliments on to your master. l shall . A craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated . Elizabeth , you look absolutely stunning . lt's so good to see you . l had a dream about you last night. About me? Yes, is that entirely proper for you -- About the day we met. Do you remember? How could l forget, Miss Swann? How many times must l ask you to call me Elizabeth? At least once more, Miss Swann , as always. There. See? At least the boy has a sense of propriety. We really must be going . There you are. Good day, Mr. Turner. Come along . Good day. Hold up, there, you . lt's a shilling to tie up your boat at the dock. And l shall need to know your name. What do you say to three shillings, and we forget the name? Welcome to Port Royal , Mr. Smith . Two paces march ! Right about-face! Present arms! This dock is off limits to civilians. l'm terribly sorry. l didn't know. lf l see one, l shall inform you immediately. There's some sort of high-toned and fancy to-do up at the fort. How could it be two upstanding gentlemen such as yourselves did not merit an invitation? Someone has to make sure this dock stays off limits. lt's a fine goal , to be sure. But it seems to me that a ship like that makes this one here a bit superfluous, really. The Dauntless is the power in these waters, true. But there's no ship as can match the lnterceptor for speed . l've heard of one. lt's supposed to be very fast. Nigh uncatchable. The Black Pearl. Well , there's no real ship as can match the lnterceptor. Black Pearl is a real ship. No. No, it's not. Yes, it is. l've seen it. You've seen it? Yes. You haven't seen it. Yes, l have. You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that Hell itself spat him back out? No. No. But l have seen a ship with black sails. No ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that Hell spat him out could possibly have black sails, therefore couldn't be any other ship than the Black Pearl. ls that what you're saying? No. Like l said , there's no real ship as can match the lnterceptor. You ! Get away from there! You don't have permission to be there. l'm sorry. lt's such a pretty boat. Ship. What's your name? Smith . Or Smithy, if you like. What's your purpose in Port Royal , Mr. Smith? Yeah . And no lies. Well , then , l confess. lt is my intention to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, raid , pillage, plunder, and otherwise pilfer my weaselly black guts out. -l said no lies. -l think he's telling the truth . lf he were telling the truth , he wouldn't have told us. Unless you wouldn't believe the truth even if he told you . May l have a moment? You look lovely, Elizabeth . l apologize if l seem forward , but l must speak my mind . This promotion throws into sharp relief that which l have not yet achieved . A marriage to a fine woman . You have become a fine woman , Elizabeth . l can't breathe. Yes, l'm a bit nervous myself. And then they made me their chief. My God . The rocks! Sir, it's a miracle she missed them . -Will you be saving her? -l can't swim . Pride of the King's Navy, you are. Do not lose these. What was that? Make way! l got her! She's not breathing ! Move! l never would've thought of that. Clearly you've never been to Singapore. Where did you get that? On your feet. Are you all right? Yes, l'm fine. Shoot him . -Father. -What? Commodore, do you really intend to kill my rescuer? l believe thanks are in order. Had a brush with the East lndia Trading Company, did we, pirate? Hang him . Keep your guns on him , men . Gillette, fetch some irons. Well , well . Jack Sparrow, isn't it? Captain Jack Sparrow, if you please, sir. Well , l don't see your ship, Captain . l'm in the market, as it were. He said he'd come to commandeer one. Told you he was telling the truth . These are his, sir. No additional shot nor powder. A compass that doesn't point North . And l half expected it to be made of wood . You are without doubt the worst pirate l've ever heard of. But you have heard of me. Commodore, l really must protest. Carefully, Lieutenant. Pirate or not, this man saved my life. One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness. Though it seems enough to condemn him . lndeed . Finally. No. No! Don't shoot! l knew you'd warm up to me. Commodore Norrington , my effects, please. And my hat. Commodore. -lt is Elizabeth , isn't it? -lt's Miss Swann . Miss Swann , if you'd be so kind . Come, come, dear. We don't have all day. Now if you'll be very kind . Easy on the goods, darling . You're despicable. Sticks and stones, love. l saved your life. You save mine. We're square. Gentlemen , milady, you will always remember this as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow. Now will you shoot him? Open fire! On his heels! Take cover, man ! Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has a dawn appointment with the gallows. l would hate for him to miss it. Search upstairs! Look lively, men ! Right where l left you . Not where l left you . You're the one they're hunting . The pirate. You seem familiar. Have l threatened you before? l make a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates. lt would be a shame to put a mark on your record . So if you'll excuse me. Do you think this wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate? You threatened Miss Swann . Only a little. You know what you're doing . l'll give you that. Excellent form . But how's your footwork? lf l step here. Very good . And now l step again . That is a wonderful trick. Except, once again , you are between me and my way out. And now you have no weapon . Who makes all these? l do. And l practice with them three hours a day. You need to find yourself a girl , mate. Or perhaps the reason you practice three hours a day is that you found one and are otherwise incapable of wooing said strumpet. You're not a eunuch , are you? l practice three hours a day so when l meet a pirate, l can kill it! You cheated . Pirate. Move away. No. -Please move. -No. l cannot just step aside and let you escape. This shot is not meant for you . There he is! Over here! Excellent work, Mr. Brown . You've assisted in the capture of a fugitive. Just doing my civic duty, sir. l trust you will remember this is the day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped . Take him away. -Can you smell it? -Come here. -lt's marrowbone. -Come here. -Want a juicy bone? -Come here. -Come here, boy! -Come on . You can keep doing that forever. The dog is never going to move. Oh , excuse us if we haven't resigned ourself to the gallows just yet. There you go, miss. lt was a difficult day for you , l'm sure. l suspected Commodore Norrington would propose. l must admit, l wasn't prepared for it. l meant you being threatened by that pirate. Sounds terrifying . Yes, it was terrifying . But the commodore proposed . Fancy that. Now, that's a smart match , miss, if it's not too bold to say. lt is a smart match . He's a fine man . He's what any woman should dream of marrying . Well , that Will Turner. He's a fine man , too. That is too bold . Well , begging your pardon , miss. lt was not my place. Has my daughter given you an answer yet? No, she hasn't. Well , she has had a very trying day. Ghastly weather, don't you think? Bleak. Very bleak. What's that? Cannon fire! Return fire! -l know those guns. -Men to arms! lt's the Pearl. The Black Pearl? l've heard stories. She's been preying on ships and settlements for near years. Never leaves any survivors. No survivors? Then where do the stories come from , l wonder? Coming through ! Sight the muzzle flash ! Aim for the flashes! l need a full strike, fore and aft. Mr. Stephens, more cartridges! Governor, barricade yourself in my office. That's an order. Don't! Hello, chum . Up there. Up there! Miss Swann , they've come to kidnap you ! What? You're the governor's daughter. ln here! Listen . They haven't seen you . The first chance you get, run to the fort. Gotcha. No! No! No! lt's hot! You burned me! Come on ! We know you're here, poppet. Poppet. Come out and we promise we won't hurt you . We will find you , poppet. You've got something of ours, and it calls to us. The gold calls to us. Gold . Hello, poppet. Parley. What? Parley. l invoke the right of parley. According to the Code of the Brethren set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you have to take me to your captain . l know the Code. lf an adversary demands parley, you can do them no harm until the parley is complete. To blazes with the Code. She wants to be taken to the captain . And she'll go without a fuss. We must honor the Code. Say goodbye. Goodbye. Come on ! Out of my way, scum ! My sympathies, friend . You've no manner of luck at all . Come on , doggy. lt's just you and me now. lt's you and old Jack. Come on . Come on . That's a boy. Good boy. Come get the bone. That's a good boy. Come on . A bit closer. A bit closer. That's it. That's it, doggy. Come on , you filthy, slimy, mangy cur. Don't do that. No, no! l didn't mean it! l didn't. This ain't the armory. Well , well , well . Look what we have here, Twigg . Captain Jack Sparrow. Last time l saw you , you were all alone on a godforsaken island , shrinking into the distance. His fortunes aren't improved much . Worry about your own fortunes, gentlemen . The deepest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers and mutineers. So there is a curse. That's interesting . You know nothing of hell . That's very interesting . l didn't know we was taking on captives. She's invoked the right of parley with Captain Barbossa. -l'm here to -- -You'll speak when spoken to. And ye will not lay a hand on those under the protection of parley. Aye, sir. My apologies, miss. Captain Barbossa, l am here to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal . There were a lot of long words in there. We're naught but humble pirates. What is it that you want? l want you to leave and never come back. l'm disinclined to acquiesce to your request. Means ''no.'' Very well . l'll drop it. Me holds are bursting with swag . That bit of shine matters to us? Why? lt's what you've been searching for. l recognize this ship. l saw it eight years ago on the crossing from England . Did you , now? Fine. l suppose if it is worthless, there's no point in me keeping it. You have a name, missy? Elizabeth Turner. l'm a maid in the governor's household . Miss Turner. Bootstrap. How does a maid own a trinket such as that? Family heirloom , perhaps? l didn't steal it, if that's what you mean . Very well . Hand it over. We'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return . Our bargain? Still the guns and stow them . Wait! You have to take me to shore! According to the Code -- First, your return to shore was not part of our agreement. So l must do nothing . You must be a pirate for the Pirate's Code to apply, and you're not. Thirdly, the Code is more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules. Welcome aboard the Black Pearl, Miss Turner. They've taken her. They've taken Elizabeth . Mr. Murtogg , remove this man . We have to hunt them down . We must save her. And where do you propose we start? lf you have information concerning my daughter, please share it. That Jack Sparrow. He talked about the Black Pearl. Mentioned it is more what he did . Ask him where it is. He could lead us to it. No. The pirates who invaded this fort left Sparrow locked in his cell , ergo they are not his allies. We will establish their most likely course. That's not good enough ! Mr. Turner, you are not a military man . You are not a sailor. You are a blacksmith . And this is not the moment for rash actions. Do not make the mistake of thinking you are the only man here who cares for Elizabeth . You . You are familiar with that ship. The Black Pearl. l've heard of it. Where does it make berth? Where does it make berth? Have you not heard the stories? Captain Barbossa and his crew of miscreants sail from the dreaded lsla de Muerta. lt's an island that cannot be found , except by those who already know where it is. The ship's real enough . lts anchorage must be a real place. Where is it? Why ask me? Because you're a pirate. And you want to turn pirate yourself, is that it? Never. They took Miss Swann . Oh , so it is that you found a girl . l see. Well , if you're intending to brave all , hasten to her rescue, and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone, mate. l see no profit in it for me. l can get you out of here. How's that? They key's run off. l helped build these cells. These are half-pin barrel hinges. With the right leverage and the proper application of strength . The door will lift free. What's your name? That would be short for William , l imagine. Good , strong name. No doubt named for your father. Yes. Well , Mr. Turner, l've changed me mind . lf you spring me from this cell , l swear on pain of death l shall take you to the Black Pearl and your bonny lass. Do we have an accord? Agreed . Agreed . Get me out. Hurry. Someone will have heard that. Not without my effects. We're going to steal the ship? That ship? Commandeer. We're going to commandeer that ship. Nautical term . One question about your business. Or there's no use going . This girl . How far are you willing to go to save her? l'd die for her. Oh , good . No worries, then . This is either madness or brilliance. lt's remarkable how often those two traits coincide. Everyone stay calm ! We are taking over the ship. Aye! Avast! This ship cannot be crewed by two men . You'll never make it out of the bay. Son , l'm Captain Jack Sparrow. Savvy? Commodore. Sir, they've taken the Dauntless! Commodore! They've taken the ship! Sparrow and Turner have taken the Dauntless! Rash , Turner. Too rash . That is without doubt the worst pirate l have ever seen . Here they come. Bring her around ! Bring her around ! Search every cabin , every hull , down to the bilges. Sailors, back to the lnterceptor. Now! Thank you , Commodore, for getting us ready to make way. We'd have had a hard time of it by ourselves. Set topsails and clear up this mess. With the wind , we won't catch them . l don't need to. Get them in range of the long nines. Hands, come about! Run out the guns! We are to fire on our own ship, sir? l'd rather see her at the bottom of the ocean than in the hands of a pirate. Commodore, he's disabled the rudder chain , sir. Abandon ship! That's got to be the best pirate l've ever seen . So it would seem . When l was a lad living in England , my mother raised me by herself. After she died , l came out here, looking for my father. ls that so? My father, Will Turner. lt was only after you learnt my name you agreed to help. Since that's what l wanted , l didn't press the matter. l'm not a simpleton , Jack. You knew my father. l knew him . Probably one of the few who knew him as William Turner. Everyone else called him Bootstrap or Bootstrap Bill . Good man . Good pirate. l swear, you look just like him . lt's not true. He was a merchant sailor. A respectable man who obeyed the law. He was a bloody pirate. A scallywag . My father was not a pirate. Put it away, son . lt's not worth you getting beat again . You ignored the rules of engagement. ln a fair fight, l'd kill you . Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair. Now, as long as you're just hanging there, pay attention . The only rules that really matter are these. What a man can do and what a man can't do. For instance, you can accept that your father was a pirate and a good man or you can't. Pirate is in your blood , so you'll have to square with that someday. Now, me, for example. l can let you drown . But l can't bring this ship into Tortuga all by me onesy, savvy? So. Can you sail under the command of a pirate? Or can you not? Tortuga? Tortuga. More importantly, it is indeed a sad life that has never breathed deep this sweet bouquet that is Tortuga, savvy? What do you think? lt'll linger. l'll tell you , mate, if every town in the world were like this one, no man would ever feel unwanted . Scarlett! Not sure l deserved that. Giselle! Giselle! Who was she? What? l may have deserved that. Curse you for breathing , you slack-jawed idiot! Mother's love! You should know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping . lt's bad luck. Fortunately, l know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink. The man who was sleeping drinks while listening to a proposition from the man who did the waking . Aye, that'll about do it. Blast! l'm already awake! That was for the smell . Keep a sharp eye. Now, what's the nature of this venture of yourn? Now, what's the nature of this venture of yourn? l'm going after the Black Pearl. l know where it's going to be, and l'm gonna take it. Jack, it's a fool's errand . You know better than me the tales of the Black Pearl. That's why l know what Barbossa is up to. All l need is a crew. From what l hear of Barbossa, he's not a man to suffer fools, nor strike a bargain with one. l'd say it's a good thing l'm not a fool . Prove me wrong . What makes you think Barbossa will give up his ship to you? Let's just say it's a matter of leverage. The kid? That is the child of Bootstrap Bill Turner. His only child , savvy? ls he, now? ''Leverage,'' says you . ''l think l feel a change in the wind ,'' says l . l'll find us a crew. There's bound to be some sailors crazy as you . One can only hope. Take what you can . Give nothing back. You'll be dining with the captain . And he requests you wear this. You tell the captain that l am disinclined to acquiesce to his request. He said you'd say that. He also said , if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew. And you'll be naked . Fine. There's no need to stand on ceremony, nor call to impress. You must be hungry. Try the wine. And the apples. One of those next? lt's poisoned . There would be no sense to be killing you . Release me. You have your trinket. l'm of no further value to you . You don't know what this is, do you? lt's a pirate medallion . This is Aztec gold . One of identical pieces they delivered in a stone chest to Cortés himself. Blood money paid to stem the slaughter he wreaked upon them with his armies. But the greed of Cortés was insatiable. So the heathen gods placed upon the gold a terrible curse. Any mortal that removes but a single piece from that stone chest shall be punished for eternity. l hardly believe in ghost stories anymore, Captain . l hardly believe in ghost stories anymore, Captain . That's exactly what l thought when we were told the tale. Buried on an island of dead what cannot be found , except for those who know where it is. Find it, we did . There be the chest. lnside be the gold . And we took them all . We spent them and traded them and frittered them away on drink and food and pleasurable company. The more we gave them away, the more we came to realize, the drink would not satisfy, food turned to ash in our mouths, and all the pleasurable company in the world could not slake our lust. We are cursed men , Miss Turner. Compelled by greed , we were, but now we are consumed by it. There is one way we can end our curse. All the scattered pieces of the Aztec gold must be restored and the blood repaid . Thanks to ye, we have the final piece. And the blood to be repaid? That's why there's no sense to be killin' you yet. Apple? No! l'm curious. After killing me, what is it you're planning on doing next? Look! The moonlight shows us for what we really are. We are not among the living , and so we cannot die. But neither are we dead . For too long l've been parched and unable to quench it. Too long l've been starving to death and haven't died . l feel nothing . Not the wind on my face nor the spray of the sea nor the warmth of a woman's flesh . You best start believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner. You're in one! What are you looking at? Back to work! You heard the captain . Back to work. Feast your eyes, Captain . All of them faithful hands before the mast. Every man worth his salt. And crazy to boot. So this is your able-bodied crew? -You , sailor! -Cotton , sir. Mr. Cotton , do you have the courage to follow orders and stay true in the face of danger and death? Mr. Cotton ! Answer, man ! He's a mute. Poor devil had his tongue cut out. He trained the parrot to talk for him . No one's yet figured how. Mr. Cotton's parrot. Same question . Wind in the sails! Wind in the sails! Mostly we figure that means ''yes.'' Of course it does. Satisfied? Well , you've proved they're mad . And what's the benefit for us? Anamaria. l suppose you didn't deserve that. No, that one l deserved . You stole my boat! Actually -- Borrowed . Borrowed without permission . But with every intention of bringing it back. But you didn't! You'll get another one. l will . A better one. A better one! That one. What one? That one? Aye, that one. What say you? Anchors aweigh ! No, no, it's frightful bad luck to bring a woman aboard , sir. lt'll be far worse not to have her. How can we sail to an island that nobody can find with a compass that doesn't work? Aye, the compass doesn't point North , but we're not trying to find North , are we? We should drop canvas, sir. She can hold a bit longer. What's in your head that's put you in such a fine mood? We're catching up. Time to go, poppet. Dead men tell no tales. Puts a chill in the bones how many honest sailors have been claimed by this passage. How is it that Jack came by that compass? Not a lot's known about Jack fore he showed up in Tortuga with a mind to go after the treasure of the lsla de Muerta. That was before l'd met him . Back when he was Captain of the Black Pearl. What? He failed to mention that. He plays things closer to the vest now. And a hard-learned lesson it was. Three days out, the first mate comes to him and says everything's an equal share. That should mean the location of the treasure. Jack gives up the bearings. That night, there was a mutiny. They marooned Jack on an island and left him to die, but not before he'd gone mad with the heat. So that's the reason for all the. . . Reason's got nothing to do with it. Now, Will , when a pirate's marooned , he's a given a pistol with a single shot. One shot. Well , that won't do much good hunting or to be rescued . But after three weeks of a starving belly and thirst, that pistol will start to look real friendly. But Jack escaped the island , and he still has that single shot. Oh , he won't use it, though , save on one man . His mutinous first mate. How did Jack get off the island? Well , l'll tell ye. He waded out into the shallows. He waited there three days and three nights till all manner of sea creatures 'came acclimated to his presence. And on the fourth morning , he roped a couple of sea turtles, lashed them together, and made a raft. He roped a couple of sea turtles? Aye, sea turtles. What did he use for rope? Human hair. From my back. Let go the anchor! Aye, Captain , aye! Young Mr. Turner and l are to go ashore. Captain , what if the worst should happen? Keep to the Code. Aye, the Code. Move. years of hoarding swag . And now we finally get to spend it. Once we're quit of the curse, we'll be rich men . You can buy an eye what actually fits and is made of glass. This one does splinter something terrible. Stop rubbing it. What Code is Gibbs to keep to if the worst should happen? Pirate's Code. Any man who falls behind is left behind . No heroes amongst thieves? For having such a bleak outlook on pirates, you're well on your way to becoming one. Sprung a man from jail , commandeered a ship of the fleet, sailed with a buccaneer crew out of Tortuga. And you're completely obsessed with treasure. That's not true. l am not obsessed with treasure. Not all treasure is silver and gold , mate. Gentlemen , the time has come! Our salvation is nigh ! Our torment is near an end . For years we've been tested and tried , and each man jack of you here has proved his mettle a hundred times over and a hundred times again ! Suffered , l have! Punished , we were, the lot of us. Disproportionate to our crime! Here it is! The cursed treasure of Cortés himself. Every last piece that went astray, we have returned . Save for this. Not yet. We wait for the opportune moment. we found , but despaired of ever finding the last. When's that? When it's of greatest profit to you? May l ask you something? Have l ever given you reason not to trust me? Do us a favor. l know it's difficult for you , but please stay here and try not to do anything stupid . And who among us has paid the blood sacrifice owed to the heathen gods? Us! And whose blood must yet be paid? Hers! You know the first thing l'm gonna do after the curse is lifted? Eat a whole bushel of apples. Begun by blood . By blood undone. Sorry, Jack. l'm not gonna be your leverage. That's it? Waste not. Did it work? -l don't feel no different. -How do we tell? You're not dead . No. He shot me! lt didn't work. The curse it still upon us! You , maid ! Your father, what was his name? Was your father William Turner? No. Where's his child that sailed from England eight years ago? The child in whose veins flows the blood of William Turner? You two! You brought us the wrong person ! No! She had the medallion . She's the proper age. She said her name was Turner. l think she lied to us. You brought us here for nothing . l won't take questioning or second guesses from you , Twigg . Who's to blame? Every decision you've made has led us from bad to worse. lt was you who sent Bootstrap to the depths! Yeah ! And it's you who brought us here in the first place. lf any coward here dare challenge me, let him speak! l say we cut her throat and spill all her blood , just in case. Yeah ! The medallion ! She's taken it! Get after her, you feckless pack of ingrates! No oars here! Where's the oars? The oars have gone missing . Find them ! Find the oars! You . You're supposed to be dead ! Am l not? Parsnip, parsley, partner, partner. Parley? That's the one! Parley! Parley! Parley? Damn to the depths whatever man that thought up ''parley''! That would be the French . Not more pirates. Welcome aboard , Miss Elizabeth . Mr. Gibbs? Hey, boy, where be Jack? He fell behind . Keep to the Code. Weigh anchor! Hoist the sails! Make quick! How the blazes did you get off that island? When you marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land , you forgot one very important thing , mate. l'm Captain Jack Sparrow. Well , l won't be making that mistake again . Gents, you all remember Captain Jack Sparrow? Kill him . The girl's blood didn't work, did it? Hold your fire! You know whose blood we need . l know whose blood you need . What sort of a man trades a man's life for a ship? Pirate. Here. Let me. Thank you . You said you gave Barbossa my name as yours. Why? l don't know. l'm sorry. Blacksmith's hands. l know they're rough . No. l mean yes, they are, but. . . But don't stop. lt's yours. l thought l'd lost it the day they rescued me. lt was a gift from my father. He sent it to me. Why did you take it? Because l was afraid that you were a pirate. That would have been awful . lt wasn't your blood they needed . lt was my father's blood . My blood . The blood of a pirate. Will , l'm so sorry. Please forgive me. You expect to leave me on some beach with nothing but a name and your word it's the one l need and watch you sail away in my ship? No. l expect to leave you standing on some beach with absolutely no name at all , watching me sail away on my ship, and then l'll shout the name back to you . Savvy? That still leaves the problem of me on some beach with naught but a name and your word it's the one l need . Of the two of us, l'm the only one who hasn't committed mutiny. Therefore, my word is the one we'll be trusting . Although , l suppose l should be thanking you because, in fact, if you hadn't betrayed me and left me to die, l would have an equal share in that curse, same as you . Funny old world , isn't it? Captain , we're coming up on the lnterceptor. l'm having a thought here, Barbossa. What say we run up a flag of truce, l scurry over to the lnterceptor, and l negotiate the return of your medallion? Now, that's exactly the attitude that lost you the Pearl. People are easy to search when they're dead . Lock him in the brig . Hands aloft to loose t'gallants! With this wind , she'll carry every sail we've got! What's happening? The Black Pearl. She's gaining on us. This is the fastest ship in the Caribbean . You can tell them that after they've caught us. We're shallower on the draft? Aye. Well , then can't we lose them amongst those shoals? We don't have to outrun them long , just long enough . Lighten the ship, stem to stern ! Anything we can afford to lose, see that it's lost. Apparently, there's a leak. Haul on the main brace! Make ready the guns! And run out the sweeps. Pull ! We're gonna need that. lt was a good plan . Up till now. We have to make a stand . We must fight! Load the guns! With what? Anything . Everything ! Anything we have left. Load the guns! Case shot and langrage! Nails and crushed glass! With a will ! The Pearl's gonna luff up on our port quarter! She'll rake us without ever presenting a target. Lower the anchor on the right side. On the starboard side! lt has the element of surprise. You're daft, lady! You both are! Daft like Jack! Lower the starboard anchor! Do it, you dogs, or it's you we'll load into the cannons! Let go! They're clubhauling ! Hard to port! Rack the starboard oars. Hard to port! Keep us steady, man . Now! Fire! Fire all ! Stop blowing holes in my ship! We could use a few more ideas, lass. Your turn . We need us a devil's dowry. We'll give them her. She's not what they're after. The medallion . Raise your colors, you bloomin' cockroaches! Hands, grapnels, at the ready. Prepare to board ! Blast all to carcasses, men ! Forward clear to the powder magazine. And the rest of you , bring me that medallion ! Help! Below! Thanks very much . Bloody empty. That's not very nice. Where's the medallion? Wretch ! Where's dear William? Monkey! l can't move it! Come on ! Why, thank you , Jack. You're welcome. Not you . We named the monkey ''Jack.'' Gents, our hope is restored ! Any of you so much as thinks the word ''parley,'' l'll have your guts for garters. You've got to stop it! -Stop it! -Welcome back, miss. You took advantage of our hospitality last time. lt holds fair now you return the favor. She goes free. What's in your head , boy? She goes free! You've only got one shot, and we can't die. Don't do anything stupid . You can't. l can . Like that. Who are you? No one. He's no one. A distant cousin of my aunt's nephew twice removed . Lovely singing voice, though . Eunuch . My name is Will Turner. My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner. His blood runs in my veins. He's the spitting image of old Bootstrap Bill come back to haunt us. On my word , do as l say, or l'll pull this trigger and be lost to Davy Jones' locker. Name your terms, Mr. Turner. Elizabeth goes free. Yes, we know that one. Anything else? And the crew. The crew are not to be harmed . Agreed . Go on , poppet, go! Walk the plank! Barbossa, you lying bastard ! You swore she'd go free! Don't dare impugn me honor, boy. l agreed she'd go free, but it was you who failed to specify when or where. Though does seem a shame to lose something so fine, don't it? So l'll be having that dress back before you go. l always liked you . Goes with your black heart. Ooh , it's still warm . Off you go! Come on ! Too long ! l'd really rather hoped we were past all this. Did you not notice? That be the same island we made you governor of on our last little trip. l did notice. Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up another miraculous escape. But l doubt it. Off you go. Yeah . Last time, you left me a pistol with one shot. By the powers, you're right. Where be Jack's pistol? Bring it forward . Seeing as there's two of us, a gentleman would give us a pair of pistols. lt'll be one pistol as before, You can be the gentleman and shoot the lady and starve to death yourself. That's the second time l've had to watch that man sail away with my ship. But you were marooned on this island before. We can escape the same way you did . To what point and purpose, young missy? The Black Pearl is gone. Unless you have a rudder and sails hidden in that bodice. Unlikely. Young Mr. Turner will be dead long before you can reach him . But you're Captain Jack Sparrow. You vanished from seven agents of the East lndia Company. You sacked Nassau Port without even firing a shot. Are you the pirate l've read about or not? How did you escape last time? Last time, l was here a grand total of three days, all right? Last time. . . The rumrunners used this island as a cache, came by, and l was able to barter passage off. From the looks of things, they've long been out of business. Probably have your bloody friend Norrington to thank for that. So that's it, then? That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow? You spent three days lying on a beach , drinking rum? Welcome to the Caribbean , love. We're devils, we're black sheep We're really bad eggs Drink up, me hearties, yo ho A pirate's life for me l love this song ! Really bad eggs! When l get the Pearl back, l'm gonna teach it to the whole crew. We'll sing it all the time. You'll be the most fearsome pirate in the Spanish Main . Not just the Spanish Main , love. The entire ocean . The entire world . Wherever we want to go, we go. That's what a ship is, you know. lt's not just a keel and a deck and sails. That's what a ship needs. But what a ship is, what the Black Pearl really is, is freedom . Jack, it must be really terrible for you to be trapped on this island . Oh , yes. But the company is infinitely better than last time, l think. The scenery has definitely improved . Mr. Sparrow. l'm not entirely sure l've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk. l know exactly what you mean , love. To freedom . To the Black Pearl. No! Not good ! Stop! Not good ! What are you doing? You burned all the food , the shade! The rum ! Yes, the rum is gone. Why is the rum gone? One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two, that signal is over a thousand feet high . The entire Royal Navy is looking for me. Do you think there is the slightest chance they won't see? But why is the rum gone? Just wait, Captain Sparrow. You give it one hour, maybe two, and you will see white sails on that horizon . ''Must've been terrible for you to be trapped here, Jack.'' Well , it bloody is now! There'll be no living with her after this. -But we've got to save Will . -No. You're safe now. You're safe now. We will return to Port Royal , not go gallivanting after pirates! Then we condemn him to death . The boy's fate is regrettable, but so was his decision to engage in piracy. To rescue me. To prevent anything from happening to me. lf l may be so bold as to inject my professional opinion . The Pearl was listing near to scuppers after the battle. lt's very unlikely she'll be able to make good time. Think about it. The Black Pearl. The last real pirate threat in the Caribbean , mate. How can you pass that up, right? By remembering that l serve others, Mr. Sparrow. Not only myself. Commodore, l beg you , please do this. For me. As a wedding gift. Are you accepting the commodore's proposal? l am . A wedding ! l love weddings! Drinks all around ! l know. ''Clap him in irons,'' right? Mr. Sparrow, you will accompany these fine men to the helm and provide us with a bearing to lsla de Muerta. You will spend the rest of the voyage contemplating all meanings of the phrase ''silent as the grave.'' Do l make myself clear? lnescapably clear. Shiver me timbers. Cotton here says you missed a bit. You knew William Turner? Ol' Bootstrap Bill . We knew him . Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we did to Jack Sparrow. The mutiny and all . He said it wasn't right with the Code. That's why he sent off a piece of the treasure to you . He said we deserved to be cursed . And remain cursed . Stupid blighter. Good man . Well , as you can imagine, that didn't sit too well with the captain . That didn't sit too well with the captain at all . -Tell him what Barbossa did . -l'm telling the story! So, what the captain did . He strapped a cannon to Bootstrap's bootstraps. Bootstrap's bootstraps. And last we saw of Ol' Bill Turner, he was sinking to the crushing , black oblivion of Davy Jones' locker. 'Course it was only after that we learned we needed his blood to lift the curse. That's what you call ironic. Bring him . l don't care for the situation . Any attempt to storm the caves could turn to an ambush . Not if you're the one doing the ambushing . l convince Barbossa to send his men out with their little boats. You and your mates return to the Dauntless and blast the bejesus out of them with your little cannons. What do you have to lose? Nothing l'd lament being rid of. Now, to be quite honest with you , there's a risk to those aboard the Dauntless, which includes the future Mrs. Commodore. Sorry, but it's for your own safety. The commodore ordered ! l have to tell him ! The pirates! They're cursed ! They can't be killed ! Don't worry. He's informed of that. A mermaid flopped up on deck and told him the whole story. This is Jack Sparrow's doing ! No reason to fret. Just a prick of the finger. A few drops of blood . No mistakes this time. He's only half Turner. We spill it all ! Guess there is reason to fret. Beg your pardon . Beg your pardon . -Begun by blood . -Excuse me. By blood -- lt's not possible. Not probable. Where's Elizabeth? She's safe, just like l promised . She's set to marry Norrington , like she promised . You get to die for her, like you promised . So we're all men of our word , really. Except for Elizabeth who is, in fact, a woman . Shut up! You're next. You don't want to be doing that, mate. No, l really think l do. Your funeral . Why don't l want to be doing it? Well , because. . . Because the HMS Dauntless, pride of the Royal Navy, is floating just offshore, waiting for you . What we doing here? The pirates come out, unprepared and unawares. We catch them in a crossfire, send them down to see Old Hob. l know why we're here. l meant, why aren't we doing what Mr. Sparrow said we should do with the cannons and all? Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it. You think he wasn't telling the truth? Just hear me out, mate. You order your men to row to the Dauntless. They do what they do best. Robert's your uncle. Fannie's your aunt. There you are with two ships. The makings of your very own fleet. You'll take the grandest as your flagship, and who's to argue? But what of the Pearl? Name me captain . l'll sail under your colors. l'll give you % of me plunder. And you get to introduce yourself as Commodore Barbossa. Savvy? l suppose in exchange, you want me not to kill the whelp. No, no, no. Not at all . By all means, kill the whelp. Just not yet. Wait to lift the curse until the opportune moment. For instance. . . After you've killed Norrington's men . Every last one. You've been planning this from the beginning . Ever since you learned my name. Yeah . l want % of your plunder. - % . - % . % . l'll buy you the hat. A really big one, Commodore. We have an accord . All hands to the boats! Apologies. You give the orders. Gents, take a walk. Not to the boats? Hold fire. Oh , this is just like what the Greeks done at Troy. Except they was in a horse instead of dresses. Wooden horse. A moment, please. l just want you to know l believe you made a very good decision today. Couldn't be more proud of you . But, you know, even a good decision , if made for the wrong reasons, can be a wrong decision . Look into that. Report back. Lieutenant? Are you there? Elizabeth , are you even listening to me? Oh , what have you done? Stop that! Already feel like a fool . Look nice, though . l look nice? l must admit, Jack, l thought l had you figured . But it turns out you're a hard man to predict. Me? l'm dishonest. And a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly. lt's the honest ones you want to watch for, because you can never predict when they're going to do something incredibly stupid . You're off the edge of the map, mate. Here there be monsters. Right! What would you pick to eat first? l think we should decide now. Just so we're ready when the time comes. What was that? Miss Elizabeth ! Make for the ship! Move! To the ship! Row, men ! You can't beat me, Jack. That's interesting . l couldn't resist, mate. Sorry! So what now, Jack Sparrow? Are we to be two immortals locked in an epic battle until judgment day and trumpets sound? Or you could surrender. All of you with me! Will is in that cave. We must save him . Ready. And heave! Please, l need your help! Come on ! Any port in a storm . Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl. What about Jack? Are you gonna leave him? Jack owes us a ship. There's the Code to consider. The Code? You're pirates. Hang the Code, and hang the rules! They're more like guidelines anyway. Bloody pirates! What? ls it supposed to be doing that? They're stealing our ship! Bloody pirates! Boarders, away! Come on ! Me eye! l'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain ! Do you like pain? Try wearing a corset. Whose side is Jack on? At the moment? No fair. Ten years you carry that pistol , and now you waste your shot. He didn't waste it. l feel . . . Cold . Parley? The ship is ours, gentlemen . We should return to the Dauntless. Your fiancé will be wanting to know you're safe. lf you were waiting for the opportune moment. . . That was it. lf you'd be so kind , l'd be much obliged if you'd drop me off at my ship. l'm sorry, Jack. They done what's right by them . Can't expect more than that. ''Jack Sparrow, be it known that you . . .'' Captain . Captain Jack Sparrow. ''For your willful commission of crimes against the crown .'' ''Said crimes being numerous in quantity and sinister in nature. The most egregious of these to be cited herewith . Piracy, smuggling . . .'' This is wrong . Commodore Norrington is bound by the law. As are we all . ''lmpersonating an officer of the Spanish Royal Navy. lmpersonating a cleric of the church of England .'' Ah , yeah . ''Sailing under false colors, arson , kidnapping , looting , poaching , brigandage, pilfering , depravity, depredation , and general lawlessness. And for these crimes you have been sentenced to be, on this day, hung by the neck until dead . May God have mercy on your soul .'' Governor Swann . Commodore. l should have told you every day from the moment l met you . l love you . Marines. l can't breathe. Move! What. . . Move! Come on ! -Right! -Come on , lads! l thought we might endure some ill-conceived escape attempt. But not from you . On our return to Port Royal , l granted you clemency. And this is how you thank me? By throwing in your lot with him? He's a pirate! And a good man . lf all l have achieved is the hangman will earn two pairs of boots instead of one, so be it. My conscience will be clear. You forget your place, Turner. lt's right here between you and Jack. As is mine. Lower your weapons. For goodness sake, put them down ! So this is where your heart truly lies, then? lt is. Well ! l'm actually feeling rather good about this. l think we've all arrived at a special place. Spiritually. Ecumenically. Grammatically. l want you to know that l was rooting for you , mate. Know that. lt would never have worked between us, darling . l'm sorry. Nice hat. Friends. This is a day that you will always remember as the day that. . . ldiot. He has nowhere to go but back to the noose. Sail ho! What's your plan of action? Sir? Perhaps on the rare occasion pursuing the right course demands an act of piracy, piracy itself can be the right course? Mr. Turner. l will accept the consequences of my actions. This is a beautiful sword . l would expect the man who made it to show the same care in every aspect of his life. Thank you . Commodore! What about Sparrow? Well , l think we can afford to give him one day's head start. So. This is the path you've chosen , is it? After all , he is a blacksmith . No. He's a pirate. Heave! Thought you were supposed to keep to the Code. We figured they were more actual guidelines. Thank you . Captain Sparrow. The Black Pearl is yours. On deck, you scabrous dogs! Hands to braces! Let down and haul to run free! Now, bring me that horizon . And really bad eggs. Drink up, me hearties, yo ho!
Special help by SergeiKVoila! Finally, the Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End script is here for all you fans of the Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley movie. This puppy is a transcript that was painstakingly transcribed using the screenplay and/or viewings of the movie to get the dialogue. I know, I know, I still need to get the cast names in there and all that jazz, so if you have any corrections, feel free to drop me a line. At least you'll have some Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End quotes (or even a monologue or two) to annoy your coworkers with in the meantime, right?
 "In order to affect a timely halt to deteriorating conditions and to ensure the common good, a state of emergency is declared for these territories by decree of Lord Cutler Beckett, duly appointed representative of His Majesty, the king. By decree, according to martial law, the following statutes are temporarily amended: Right to assembly, suspended. Right to habeas corpus, suspended. Right to legal counsel, suspended. Right to verdict by a jury of peers, suspended. By decree, all persons found guilty of piracy, or aiding a person convicted of piracy, or associating with a person convicted of piracy... ...shall be sentenced to hang by the neck until dead." The king and his men The king and his men stole the queen from her bed and bound her in her Bones. The seas be ours and by the powers where we will, we'll roam. Yo, ho, All hands haul together, hoist the Colors high. Heave ho, thieves and beggars, never shall we die. Yo, ho, haul together, hoist the Colors high. Lord Beckett! They've started to sing, sir. - Finally. - Thieves and beggars never shall we die. Some men have died, and some are alive Others sail on the sea and others sail on the sea with the keys to the cage and the Devil to pay We lay to Fiddler's Green The bell has been raised from its watery grave Hear its sepulchral tone A call to all Pay heed the squall We are a call to all, pay head the squall Turn your sails to home and turn your sail toward home! Yo, ho, haul together, Hoist the colors high Heave-ho - Thieve... - Thief and beggar. never say we die. A dangerous song to be singing... ...for any who are ignorant of its meaning. Particularly a woman. Particularly a woman alone. What makes you think she's alone? You protect her? And what makes you think I need protecting? Your master's expecting us. And an unexpected death'd cast a slight pall on our meeting. Pick those feet up! On the double! Eyes front! No, no, no. None. It always takes me about a week to get my sea legs. I was throwing up horribly the last time. Steady as she goes. All right. Have you heard anything from Will? I trust young Turner to acquire the charts and you to remember your place in the presence of Captain Sao Feng. Is he that terrifying? He's much like myself, but absent my merciful nature and sense of fair play. We're through. Make ready. Hurry now. Do you think because she is a woman we would not suspect her of treachery? Well, when you put it that way... Remove. Please. Remove. Please. Captain Barbossa, welcome to Singapore. More steam. None of that. If things don't go the way we want, then we're the only chance they've got. I understand that you have a request to make of me. More of a proposal to put to ye. I've a venture underway and I find myself in need of a ship and a crew. Hmm. It's an odd coincidence. Because you happen to have a ship and a crew you don't need? No. Because earlier this day, not far from here, a thief broke into my most revered uncle's temple and tried to make off with these. The navigational charts. The route to the Farthest Gate. Wouldn't it be amazing if this venture of yours took you to the world beyond this one? It would strain credulity at that. This is the thief. Is his face familiar to you? Then I guess he has no further need for it. No, no! You come into my city and you betray my hospitality. - I assure you I had no idea... - That he would get caught! You intend to attempt the voyage to Davy Jones' Locker. But I cannot help but wonder... Why? The song has been sung. The time is upon us. We must convene the Brethren Court. As one of the nine pirate lords, you must honor the call. More steam. More steam! - There is a price on all our heads. - Aye. It is true. It seems the only way a pirate can turn a profit anymore... ...is by betraying other pirates. We must put our differences aside. Wait for the signal. The First Brethren Court gave us rule of the seas. But now that rule is being challenged by Lord Cutler Beckett. Against East India Trading Company, what value is the Brethren Court? What can any of us do? You can fight! Get off me! You are Sao Feng, the pirate lord of Singapore. You command in an age of piracy where bold captains sail free waters. Where waves aren't measured in feet, but as increments of fear, and those who pass the test become legend. Would you have that era come to an end on your watch? The most notorious pirates from around the world are uniting against our enemy, and yet you sit here cowering in your bathwater! Elizabeth Swann. Elizabeth Swann There is more to you than meets the eye, isn't there? And the eye does not go wanting. But I cannot help but notice you have failed to answer my question. What is it you seek in Davy Jones' Locker? Jack Sparrow. He's one of the pirate lords. The only reason... ...I would want Jack Sparrow returned from the land of the dead... ...is so I can send him back myself! Jack Sparrow holds one of the nine pieces of eight. He failed to pass it along to a successor before he died. So we must go and get him back. So you admit... ...you have deceived me. Weapons! Weapons. Sao Feng, I assure you, our intentions are strictly honorable. Drop your weapons or I kill the man! Kill him. He's not our man. If he's not with you, and he's not with us... ...who's he with? Charge! Will! Will! Look out! Look behind you! Ready! Fire. Chart! Boo! Company! Make ready. Set. Fire! Company! Make ready. Set. Fire! It's an odd coincidence, isn't it? The East India Trading Company finds me the day you show up in Singapore. It is coincidence only. If you want to make a deal with Beckett, you need what I offer. You cross Barbossa. You are willing to cross Jack Sparrow. Why should I expect any better? I need the Black Pearl to free my father. You're helping me to get it. Uh-oh. Fire in the hole. Thank you, Jack. Thank you, Jack. - You have the charts? - And better yet. - A ship and a crew. - Where's Sao Feng? He'll cover our escape and meet us at Shipwreck Cove. This way. Be quick. Haul the snotters with a will! Keep it taut. Secure provisions and stow the cargo. There's no place left for Sao Feng to cower. Do you think he will honor the call? I cannot say. There's an evil on these seas that even the most staunch and bloodthirsty pirates have come to fear. A piece of eight. Nine of them, you say. Our new friend in Singapore was very specific, sir. Nine pieces of eight. What's the significance of that, I wonder. Nothing can hold against the armada. Not with the Flying Dutchman at the lead. Nothing we know of. Did your friend mention where the Brethren Court are meeting? He was mum on that, sir. Hmm. Then he knows the value of information. Better keep this between ourselves. We don't want anyone running off to Singapore, do we? - Ah, admiral. - You summoned me, Lord Beckett. Yes. Something for you there. Your new station deserves an old friend. - Not more requisition orders. - No, sir. Execution. The Brethren know they face extinction. All that remains is for them to decide where they make their final stand. No one said anything about cold. I'm sure there must be a good reason for our suffering. Why don't that obeah woman bring Jack back the same way - she brought back Barbossa? - Because Barbossa was only dead. Jack Sparrow is taken, body and soul, to a place not of death, but punishment. The worst fate a person can bring upon himself... ...stretching on forever. That's what awaits at Davy Jones' Locker. Yeah. I knew there was a good reason. Nothing here is set. These can't be as accurate as modern charts. No. But it leads to more places. "Over the edge. Over again." "Sunrise sets. Flash of green." Do you care to interpret, Captain Barbossa? Ever gazed upon the green flash, Master Gibbs? I reckon I seen my fair share. Happens on rare occasion. The last glimpse of sunset, a green flash shoots up into the sky. Some go their whole lives without ever seeing it. Some claim to have seen it who ain't. And some say... It signals when a soul comes back to this world from the dead. - Sorry. - Trust me, young Master Turner. It's not getting to the land of the dead that's the problem. It's getting back. Bosun! Head to wind! Lift the sail! Bosun! Head to wind! Lift the sail! Aye, aye, sir! Bloody hell. There's nothing left. Jones is a loose cannon, sir. Fetch the chest. And the governor? He's been asking questions about the heart. Does he know? Then perhaps his usefulness has run its course. Step lively, men. Step lively! Stand fast! Steady, men. Go. All of you. And take that infernal thing with you. I will not have it on my ship! Oh, I'm sorry to hear that... because I will. Because it seems to be the only way to ensure that this ship do as directed by the company. We need prisoners to interrogate, which tends to work best when they're alive. The Dutchman sails as its captain commands. And its captain is to sail it as commanded. I would have thought you'd learned that when I ordered you to kill your pet. This is no longer your world, Jones. The immaterial has become... ...immaterial. Charge your bayonets. How long do we continue not talking? Once we rescue Jack, everything'll be fine. Then we rescue Jack. For what we want most... ...there is a cost must be paid in the end. - Barbossa, ahead! - Aye, we're good and lost now. - Lost? - For certain you have to be lost to find a place as can't be found. Elseways, everyone would know where it was. - We're gaining speed. - Aye. To stations! All hands to stations! Huh? Rudder full. Hard aport! Gather way. Nay! Belay that! Let her run straight and true! Blimey. - You've doomed us all. - Don't be so unkind. You may not survive to pass this way again, and these be the last friendly words you'll hear. Tie her off. Hard aport. Hold on! Strike your colors, you blooming cockroaches. Dead men tell no tales. My peanut. Haul the halyard. Slacken braces. Aye, captain. Slacken braces. Step lively with a will. - Aye, aye. - Right away, sir. I want a fire down below! - Help. - Man the yards, you filthy toads. Haul! Haul! Haul the sheets handsomely. Scandalize the lateens. - Aye, sir. - Right away, sir. - Mr. Sparrow? - Aye, cap'n. What say you about the condition of this tack line? - It be proper to my eyes, sir. - Proper? It is neither proper nor suitable, sir. It is not acceptable nor adequate. It is, in obvious fact, an abomination. Begging your pardon, sir, but if you gave a man another chance. Shall I? It's that sort of thinking got us into this mess. We have lost speed and, therefore, time. Precious time, which cannot be recovered once lost. Do you understand? - Aye, aye, captain. - Do you now? It will all have to be redone. All of it. And let this serve as a lesson to the lot of you. Doldrums, sir, has the entire crew on edge. I have no sympathy for any of you feculent maggots, and no more patience to pretend otherwise. Gentlemen, I wash my hands of this weirdness. No wind. Of course, there's no bloody wind. My soul I do swear for a breeze. Gust. Whisper. A tiny, miniature lick. Yes, sir, I know, but why? Why would he do that? Because he's a lummox, isn't he? We shall have a magnificent garden party and you're not invited. Shoo. A rock. Now we're being followed by rocks. Never had that before. Oh. A rope. This truly is a godforsaken place. I don't see Jack. I don't see anyone. He's here. Davy Jones never once gave up that what he took. And does it matter? We're trapped here by your doing. No different than Jack. Witty Jack is closer than you think. Impossible. Boat. Slap me thrice and hand me to me mama. It's Jack. - It's the captain! - A sight for sore eyes. Hide the rum. - Mr. Gibbs. - Aye, cap'n. I thought so. I expect you're able to account for your actions, then. Sir? There's been a perpetual and virulent lack of discipline upon my vessel. Why? - Why is that, sir? - Sir, you're... You're in Davy Jones' Locker, cap'n. I know that. I know where I am. - And don't think I don't. - Jack Sparrow. - Jack Sparrow Oh, Hector. It's been too long. Hasn't it? Aye. Isla de Muerta, remember? You shot me. No, I didn't. Tia Dalma, out and about, eh? You add an agreeable sense of the macabre to any delirium. He thinks we're a hallucination. William, tell me something: Have you come because you need my help to save a certain distressing damsel, or rather, damsel in distress? Either one. No. Well, then, you wouldn't be here, would you? So you can't be here. Q.E.D., you're not really here. Jack. Jack This is real. We're here. - The Locker, you say? - Aye. We've come to rescue you. Have you, now? That's very kind of you. But it would seem that as I possess a ship and you don't, you're the ones in need of rescuing, and I'm not sure as I'm in the mood. I see my ship. Right there. Can't spot it. Must be a tiny little thing hiding somewhere behind the Pearl. Jack, Cutler Beckett has the heart of Davy Jones. - He controls the Flying Dutchman. - He's taking over the seas. The song has been sung. The Brethren Court is called. Leave you alone for a minute, look what happens. Everything's gone to pot. Aye. The world needs you back something fierce. And you need a crew. Why should I sail with any of you? Four of you have tried to kill me in the past. One of you succeeded. Oh, she's not told you. You'll have loads to talk about while you're here. As for you... Now... don't tell me you didn't enjoy it at the time. Fair enough. All right, you're in. Don't need you. You scare me. Gibbs, you can come. Marty. Mm... - Cotton. Cotton Cotton's parrot, I'm a little iffy, but at least I'll have someone to talk to. Who are you? Tai Huang. These are my men. - Where do your allegiances lie? - With the highest bidder. - I have a ship. - That makes you the highest bidder. Good man. Weigh anchor, all hands. Prepare to make sail. Weigh anchor. Jack... Jack... Which way are you going, Jack? Trim that sail. Slack windward brace and sheet. - Haul the pennant line. - Haul the pennant line. What are you doing? - What are you doing? - No, what are you doing? - What are you doing? - No, what are you doing? What are you? Captain gives orders on the ship. The captain of the ship is giving orders. - My ship, makes me captain. - They be my charts. That makes you "chartman." Stow it! The both of you! That's an order! Understand?! Sorry. I just thought with the captain issue in doubt, I'd throw in my name for consideration. Sorry. - I'd vote for you. - Yeah? You left Jack to the Kraken. He's rescued now. It's done with. Will, I had no choice. You chose not to tell me. I couldn't. It wasn't your burden to bear. But I did bear it, didn't I? I just didn't know what it was. I thought... You thought I loved him. If you make your choices alone, how can I trust you? You can't. Eerie. That's downright macabre. I wonder what would happen if you dropped a cannonball on one of them? Be disrespectful, it would. They should be in the care of Davy Jones. That was the duty him was charged with... ...by the goddess, Calypso. To ferry those who die at sea to the other side. And every ten years... ...him could come ashore... ...to be with she who love him... truly. But the man has become a monster. So he wasn't always... tentacley? No. Him was a man... ...once. Now there's boats coming. They're not a threat to us. Am I right? We are nothing but ghosts to them. It's best just let them be. It's my father. We've made it back. Father! Father, here, look here! Elizabeth. Elizabeth We're not back. Father! Elizabeth. Are you dead? No. No. I think I am. No, you can't be. There was this chest, you see. It's odd. At the time it seemed so important. Come aboard. And a heart. I learned that if you stab the heart, yours must take its place. And you will sail the seas for eternity. The Dutchman must have a captain. Silly thing to die for. Someone, cast a line. Come back with us! Come on. A touch... of destiny. Take the line. I'm so proud of you, Elizabeth. Father, the line! Take the line! - She must not leave the ship! - Father! Please come with us! Please! No! I won't leave you! I'll give your love to your mother. - Please, I won't let you go! - Elizabeth. - Elizabeth - Elizabeth. Elizabeth Is there a way? Him at peace. No water. Why is all but the rum gone? Rum's gone too. If we cannot escape these doldrums before night, I fear we will sail on trackless seas. Doomed to roam the reach between worlds. Forever. With no water, forever looks to be arriving a mite too soon. Why doesn't he do something? - Me eye. Give it back! - There's no sense to it. And the green flash happens at sunset, not sunrise. "Over the edge." Ah, it's driving me over the blooming edge. Sunrises don't set. "Up is down." Well, that's just maddeningly unhelpful. Why are these things never clear? - Clear as mud, Jackie. - What? Eh? - Stab the heart. - Don't stab the heart. - Come again? - The Dutchman must have a captain. That's even more than less than unhelpful. Sail the seas for eternity. - I love the sea. - What about port? I prefer rum. Rum's good. Making port. Where we can get rum, and salty wenches... - Once every 10 years. - What'd he say? - Once every 10 years. - Ten years is a long time, mate. Even longer given the deficit of rum. But eternity is longer still. And how will you be spending it? Dead? Or not? - The immortal Captain Sparrow. - Oh, I like that. Come sunset, it won't matter. Not sunset. Sundown. And rise. Up. What's that? What is that? I don't know. What do you think? - Where? - There. What is it? He's rocking the ship. We're rocking the ship. Aye. He's onto it. He's rocking the ship. We'll tie each other to the mast upside down, so when the boat flips we'll be the right way up. Time it with the swell. Loose the cannons, you lazy bilge rats. Unstow the cargo. Let it shift. Now up... ...is down. This was your idea. Blessed sweet westerlies! We're back! It's the sunrise. Parley? We need our pistols! Get untied, hurry! All right, then! The Brethren Court is a-gathering at Shipwreck Cove. And, Jack, you and I are a-going. There'll be no arguing that point. I is arguing the point. If there's pirates a-gathering, I'm pointing my ship the other way. The pirates are gathering to fight Beckett, and you're a pirate. Fight or not, you're not running, Jack. If we don't stand together, they'll hunt us down one by one, till there be none left but you. Quite like the sound of that. Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate. Aye. And you'll be fighting Jones alone. How does that figure into your plan? I'm still working on that. But I will not be going back to the Locker, mate. Count on that. Wet powder. Wait! We can still use them as clubs! - Ow! - Sorry. Effective, though. There's fresh water on this island. We can resupply there and get back to shooting each other later. You lead the shore party. I'll stay with my ship. I'll not be leaving my ship in your command. Why don't you both go ashore and leave the ship in my command. Temporarily. Mind the boat. - Criminy. - Odds bodkins! Careful! Careful! You stupid fish! Actually it's a cephalopod. Serves you right. Pin, I bet people would pay a shilling to see this. And another shilling for a sketch of them sitting atop! Pintel and Ragetti, Kraken slayers. We could serve up a slice as a souvenir. Still thinking of running, Jack? Think you can outrun the world? You know, the problem with being the last of anything... ...by and by, there be none left at all. Sometimes things come back, mate. We're living proof, you and me. Aye, but that's a gamble of long odds, ain't it? There's never a guarantee of coming back. But passing on, that's dead certain. Summoning the Brethren Court, then, is it? It's our only hope, lad. That's a sad commentary in and of itself. The world used to be a bigger place. The world's still the same. There's just... less in it. Poisoned. Fouled by the body. Eh, I know him. He was in Singapore! - Singapore. - Captain! Hoy! We got company! He's the captain. Sao Feng... ...you showing up here, it is truly a remarkable coincidence. Jack Sparrow. Jack Sparrow You paid me great insult once. That doesn't sound like me. Shall we just call it square, then? Release her. - She's not part of the bargain. - And what bargain be that? You heard Captain Turner. - Release her! - "Captain Turner"? Aye, the perfidious rotter led a mutiny against us! I need the Pearl to free my father. That's the only reason I came on this voyage. Why didn't you tell me you were planning this? It was my burden to bear. He needs the Pearl. Captain Turner needs the Pearl. And you felt guilty. And you and your Brethren Court. Did no one come to save me just because they missed me? I'm standing with them. I'm sorry, Jack, but there is an old friend who wants to see you first. I'm not certain I can survive any more visits from old friends. Here is your chance to find out. Curious. Your friends appear to be quite desperate, Jack. Perhaps they no longer believe that a gathering of squabbling pirates can defeat the Flying Dutchman. And so despair leads to betrayal. But you and I are no strangers to betrayal, are we? It's not here, Jack. What? What isn't? The heart of Davy Jones. It's safely aboard the Dutchman, and so unavailable for use as leverage to satisfy your debt to the good captain. By my reckoning, that account has been settled. By your death? And yet here you are. Close your eyes and pretend it's all a bad dream. That's how I get by. And if Davy Jones were to learn of your survival? Ship oars. Ship oars. Be on your guard, men. My men are crew enough. Company ship, company crew. You agreed. The Black Pearl was to be mine. And so it was. Perhaps you'll consider an alternative arrangement. One which requires absolutely nothing from you but information. Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt. In exchange for fair compensation? Square my debt with Jones... ...guarantee my freedom? Of course. It's just good business. Were I in a divulgatory mood, what then might I divulge? Everything. Where are they meeting? Who are the pirate lords? What is the purpose of the nine pieces of eight? Prepare the brig. Beckett agreed the Black Pearl was to be mine. He's not going to give up the only ship as can outrun the Dutchman, is he? Shame they're not bound to honor the code of the Brethren, isn't it? Because honor's a hard thing to come by nowadays. There is no honor to remaining with the losing side. Leaving it for the winning side, that's just good business. - The losing side, you say? - They have the Dutchman. Now the Pearl! And what do the Brethren have? We have Calypso. Calypso. An old legend. No. The goddess herself, bound in human form. Imagine all the power of the seas brought to bear against our enemy. I intend to release her. But for that I need the Brethren Court. All the Court. You can keep Barbossa. The belligerent homunculus and his friend with the wooden eye, both. And Turner. Especially Turner. The rest go with me on the Pearl. I'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove, where I will hand you the pirates and you will not hand me to Jones. - Bloody fair deal, don't you think? - And what becomes of Miss Swann? What interest is she to you? What are you proposing, captain? What be accepting, cap'n? - The girl. - What? Jack. Jack I've just recalled. I've got this wonderful compass, which points to whatever I want. So for what do I need you? Elizabeth is not part of any bargain. Out of the question. It was not a question. Points to the thing you want most. And that is not the Brethren Court, is it? - Then what is, Jack? - Me. - Dead. - Done. What? Not done. You got us into this. If it frees us, then done! Damn. Although, if I kill you, then I can use the compass to find Shipwreck Cove, is it, on my own. Cut out the middle man, as it were. Elizabeth, they are pirates. I have had more than enough experience dealing with pirates! Then we have an accord? With me killed, you'd arrive at the cove, find it a stronghold, nigh impregnable... ...able to withstand blockade for years. Then you'd be wishing,"If only there was someone I had not killed inside to ensure that the pirates then come outside." And you can accomplish all this? You may kill me, but you may never insult me. Who am I? I'm Captain Jack Sparrow. Done! Man overboard! You're mad. Thank goodness. If I wasn't, this'd probably never work. And that was without even a single drop of rum. Send this pestilent, traitorous, cowhearted, yeasty codpiece to the brig. Which ship do we follow? Signal the Dutchman to track down Sao Feng. We follow the Pearl. How soon can we have the ship ready to pursue? She's going down! Stand clear! Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along? Sir. By this time tomorrow, we will arrive at Shipwreck Cove and you will be free. Calypso. Excuse me? Not a name you fancy, I imagine, out of the many that you have... ...but it is what we call you. We being who? You confirm it. Confirm what? - You've told me nothing. - The Brethren Court, not I. The First Brethren Court, whose decision I would have opposed. They bound you to human form so the rule of the seas would belong to man and not... To me. But one such as you should never be anything less than what you are. Pretty speech from a captor. But words whispered through prison bars lose their charm. Can I be blamed for my efforts? All men are drawn to the sea, perilous though it may be. And some men offer desire as justification for their crimes. I offer simply my desire. And in return? I would have your gifts, should you choose to give them. And if I should choose not? Then I will take... ...your fury. Sao Feng? Here. Please. With all nine pieces of eight... ...you will be free. Take it! You are captain now. Me? Go in my place to Shipwreck Cove. Captain! The ship is taken. We cannot... Forgive me... Calypso. Sao. What did he tell you? He made me captain. Set! Fire! You are not my captain. Elizabeth. Elizabeth James. James. James James Thank God, you're alive. Your father'll be overjoyed - to know you're safe. - My father's dead. No, that can't be true. He returned to England. Did Lord Beckett tell you that? Who among you do you name as captain? Captain. Her. Her. Captain? Tow the ship. Put the prisoners in the brig. The captain shall have my quarters. Thank you, sir. - But I prefer to remain with my crew. - Elizabeth. - Elizabeth I swear. I did not know. Know what? Which side you chose? Well, now you do. Bootstrap? Bootstrap. Bill Turner? Bill Turner? Bootstrap. You know my name. Yes, I know your son. Will Turner. Will Turner William. William He made it. He's alive. And now he sends you to tell me that he's coming to get me. God's wounds. He's on his way. Yes, Will is alive. And he wants to help you. He can't help me. He won't come. But you're his father. I know you. He spoke of you. He can't save me. He can't come because of you. Me? You're Elizabeth. Yes, I'm Elizabeth. If Jones be slain, he who slays him must take his place. Captain... Forever. The Dutchman must always have a captain. And if he saves me... ...he loses you. I see. He won't pick me. I wouldn't pick me. Tell him not to come. Tell him to stay away. Tell him it's too late. I'm already a part of the ship... ...and the crew. Bootstrap. You know my name. You know my name. Yes, I know your son. William. William He's coming for me. Wait and see. You'll see. He promised. Swing her over. Ready those lines. Sir. A breadcrumb trail. - And we're meant to follow. - A betrayer among them? - Or a trap? - A gambit by a skilled opponent. - Adjust course, lieutenant. - Sir? We can only hope to reach our destination before they run out of bodies. You escaped the brig even quicker than I expected. William, do you notice anything? Rather... ...do you notice something that is not there to be noticed? - You haven't raised an alarm. - Odd, isn't it? Not as odd as this. Come up with this all by your lonesome, did you? I said to myself,"Think like Jack." This is what you've arrived at? Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove so as to gain his trust... ...accomplish your own ends? It's like you don't know me at all. And how does your dearly beloved feel about this plan? Ah. You've not seen fit to trust her with it. I'm losing her, Jack. Every step I make for my father is a step away from Elizabeth. If you choose to lock your heart away, you'll lose her for certain. If I might lend a machete to your intellectual thicket... ...avoid the choice altogether. Change the facts. Let someone else dispatch Jones. Who? You? Death has a curious way of reshuffling one's priorities. I slip aboard the Dutchman, find the heart, stab the beating thing, your father's free from his debt, you're free to be with your charming murderess. You're willing to cut out your heart and bind yourself to the Dutchman... ...forever? - No, mate. I'm free forever. Free to sail the seas beyond the edges of the map. Free from death itself. You have to do the job though, Jack. You have to ferry souls to the next world. Or end up just like Jones. I don't have the face for tentacles. But immortal has to count for something, eh? What's this for? Think like me. It'll come to you. My regards to Davy Jones. I hate him. Come with me. Quickly. What are you doing? Choosing a side. Do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett knows of the meeting of the Brethren. I fear there may be a traitor among them. It's too late to earn my forgiveness. I had nothing to do with your father's death. But that does not absolve me of my other sins. Come with us. James, come with me. Who goes there? Go. I will follow. You're lying. Our destinies have been entwined, Elizabeth... ...but never joined. Go, now. Back to your station, sailor. - No one leaves the ship. - Stand down. That's an order. That's an order. Part of the crew, part of the ship. Part of the crew, part of the ship. Part of the crew... - Steady, man. - Part of the crew, part of the ship. All hands, prisoner escape! - Belay that! - James! - James! Prisoner escape! James! No! - The admiral's dead. - Admiral's dead? - The admiral's dead. - Admiral's dead. - To the captain's cabin! - Aye! Back to the ship. James Norrington. Do you fear death? I take that as a "no." Nice sword. The Dutchman is under my command. For now. Look alive and keep a weather eye. Not for naught it's called Shipwreck Island. Where lies Shipwreck Cove and the town of Shipwreck. You heard him. Step lively. For all that pirates are clever clogs, we are unimaginative when it comes to naming things. Aye. I once sailed with a geezer who lost both of his arms and part of his eye. What'd you call him? Larry. I do not renege on a bargain once struck. But we agreed on ends only. The means are mine to decide. Caution, Barbossa. Do not forget it was by my power you return from the dead. Or what it mean if you fail me. Don't you forget why you had to bring me back. Why I could not leave Jack to his well-deserved fate. It took nine pirate lords to bind you, Calypso. And it'll take no less than nine to set you free. Masters Pintel and Ragetti. Take this fishwife to the brig. Right this way, Mrs. Fish. I cannot be summoned like some mongrel pup. Apparently, you can. I believe you know each other. Come to join my crew again, Master Turner? Not yours. His. Jack Sparrow sends his regards. Sparrow? Sparrow? You didn't tell him. We rescued Jack from the Locker along with the Black Pearl. What else have you not told me? There is an issue far more troublesome. I believe you're familiar with a person called Calypso. Not a person. A heathen god. One who delights in cursing men with their wildest dreams and then revealing them to be hollow and naught but ash. - The world is well rid of her. - Not quite so well, actually. The Brethren Court intends to release her. No! They cannot! The First Court promised to imprison her forever. - That was our agreement. - Your agreement? I showed them how to bind her. She could not be trusted. I... She gave me no choice. We must act before they release her. You loved her. She's the one. And then you betrayed her. She pretended to love me. She betrayed me. And after which betrayal did you cut out your heart, I wonder. Do not test me. I hadn't finished that. You will free my father. And you will guarantee Elizabeth's safety. Along with my own. Your terms are steep, Mr. Turner. We will expect fair value in return. There is only one price I will accept: Calypso murdered. Calypso's aboard the Black Pearl. Jack has sailed the Black Pearl to Shipwreck Cove. And with you no longer aboard her, how do you propose to lead us there? What is it you want most? Look at them all. There's not been a gathering like this in our lifetime. And I owe them all money. As he who issued summons, I convene this, the Fourth Brethren Court. To confirm your lordship and right to be heard, present now your pieces of eight, my fellow cap'ns. Those aren't pieces of eight. They're just pieces of junk. Aye. The original plan was to use nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso. But when the First Court met, the Brethren were to a one skint broke. So change the name. To "nine pieces of whatever we happened to have in our pockets at the time?" Oh, yes. That sounds very piratey. Master Ragetti, if you will. I kept it safe, just like you said when you gave it to me. Aye, you have. But now I need it back. Sparrow. Sparrow Might I point out that we are still short one pirate lord, and I'm as content as a cucumber to wait until Sao Feng joins us. Sao Feng is dead. He fell to the Flying Dutchman. The plagued ship. He made you captain? They're giving the bloody title away now. Listen. Listen to me. Our location has been betrayed. Jones is under the command of Lord Beckett. They're on their way here. - Who is this betrayer? - Not likely anyone among us. - Where's Will? - Not among us. It matters not how they found us. The question is, what will we do now that they have? We fight. Shipwreck Cove is a fortress. A well-supplied fortress. There is no need to fight if they cannot get to us. There be a third course. In another age, at this very spot, the First Brethren Court captured the sea goddess and bound her in her bones. That was a mistake. Oh, we tamed the seas for ourselves, aye. But opened the door to Beckett and his ilk. Better were the days when mastery of seas came not from bargains struck with eldritch creatures, but from the sweat of a man's brow and the strength of his back alone. You all know this to be true. Gentlemen. Ladies. We must free Calypso. - Shoot him. - Cut out his tongue! Shoot him, cut out his tongue, then shoot his tongue. And trim that beard. Sao Feng would've agreed with Barbossa. Calypso was our enemy then, she will be our enemy now. It's unlikely her mood's improved. I would still agree with Sao Feng. We release Calypso. - You threaten me? - I silence you. - This is madness. - This is politics. Meanwhile, our enemies are bearing down upon us. If they not be here already. My sweet. You come for me. - You were expecting me. - It has been torture. Trapped in this single form. Cut off from the sea. From all that I love. From you. Ten years I devoted to the duty you charged to me. Ten years I looked after those who died at sea. And, finally, when we could be together again... ...you weren't there. Why weren't you there? It's my nature. Would you love me if I was anything but what I am? I do not love you. Many things you were, Davy Jones. But never cruel. You have corrupted your purpose... ...and so your self. And you did hide away what should always have been mine. Calypso. I will be free. And when I am, I would give you my heart. And we would be together always. If only you had a heart to give. Why did you come? And what fate have you planned for your captors? The Brethren Court? All of them, the last thing they will learn in this life... ...is how cruel I can be. And what of your fate, Davy Jones? My heart will always belong to you. It was the First Court what imprisoned Calypso. We should be the ones to set her free. And in her gratitude, she will see fit to grant us boons. Whose boons? Your boons? Utterly deceptive twaddle-speak, says I. If you have a better alternative, please, share. Cuttlefish. Aye. Let us not, dear friends, forget our dear friends, the cuttlefish. Flipping glorious little sausages. Pen them up together, they'll devour each other without a second thought. Human nature, isn't it? Or... Or fish nature. So, yes, we could hole up here well-provisioned and well-armed. Half of us would be dead within the month. Which seems quite grim to me, any way you slice it. Or... Uh... As my learned colleague so naively suggests, we can release Calypso, and we can pray that she will be merciful. I rather doubt it. Can we pretend she's anything other than a woman scorned like which fury hell hath no? We cannot. Res ipsa loquitur, tabula in naufragio. We are left with but one option. I agree with, and I cannot believe the words are coming out of me mouth... ...Captain Swann. We must fight. - You've always run away from a fight. - Have not. - Have so. - Have not. - Have so. - Have not! - You have so, and you know it. - Have not. Slander and calumny. I have only ever embraced that oldest and noblest of pirate traditions. I submit that here now that is what we all must do: We must fight... ...to run away. - Aye! - Aye! As per the code, an act of war, and this be exactly that, As per the code, an act of war, and this be exactly that, can only be declared by the pirate king. - You made that up. - Did I, now? I call on Cap'n Teague, keeper of the code. Sri Sumbhajee proclaims this all to be folly! Hang the code. Who cares a...? Code is the law. You're in my way, boy. - The code. - The code. As set forth by Morgan and Bartholomew. - That can't... How did... - Sea turtles, mate. Sea turtles. Ah. Barbossa is right. Hang on a minute. "It shall be the duties, as the king, to declare war, parley with shared adversaries..." Fancy that. There has not been a king since the First Court. And that's not likely to change. - Not likely. - Why not? See, the pirate king is elected by popular vote. And each pirate only ever votes for hisself. I call for a vote. I vote for Ammand the corsair. Capitaine Chevalle, the penniless Frenchman. Sri Sumbhajee votes for Sri Sumbhajee. Mistress Ching. Gentleman Jocard. - Elizabeth Swann. - Barbossa. - Elizabeth Swann - Barbossa Vallenueva! Vallenueva Elizabeth Swann. Elizabeth Swann - What? - I know. Curious, isn't it? Vote for me. Vote for me. What you talking about? No! Am I to understand that you lot will not be keeping to the code, then? Very well. What say you, Captain Swann, king of the Brethren Court? Prepare every vessel that floats. At dawn... ...we're at war. And so we shall go to war. What? You've seen it all, done it all. You survived. That's the trick, isn't it? To survive? It's not just about living forever, Jackie. The trick is living with yourself forever. How's Mum? She looks great. The enemy is here! Let's take them! Abandon ship. Abandon ship. Parley? You be the cur that led these wolves to our door. Don't blame Turner. He was merely the tool of your betrayal. If you wish to see its grand architect, look to your left. My hands are clean in this. Figuratively. My actions were my own and to my own purpose. - Jack had nothing to do with it. - Well spoke. Listen to the tool. Will, I've been aboard the Dutchman. I understand the burden you bear, but I fear that cause is lost. No cause is lost if there is but one fool left to fight for it. If Turner wasn't acting on your behalf, then how did he come to give me this? You made a deal with me, Jack, to deliver the pirates. And here they are. Don't be bashful. Step up. Claim your reward. Your debt to me is still to be satisfied. One hundred years in servitude aboard the Dutchman. As a start. That debt was paid, mate. With some help. - You escaped. - Technically. I propose an exchange. Will leaves with us... ...and you can take Jack. Done. - Undone. - Done. Jack's one of the nine pirate lords. You have no right. King. - As you command, your nibs. - Blackguard! If ye have something to say, I might be saying something as well. First to the finish, then? Do you fear death? You've no idea. Advise your Brethren, you can fight, and all of you will die. Or you can not fight, in which case only most of you will die. You murdered my father. He chose his own fate. And you have chosen yours. We will fight. And you will die. So be it. King? Of the Brethren Court. Courtesy of Jack. Maybe he really does know what he's doing. Bravo! You've successfully arrived aboard the Dutchman as per the overall scheme. - Look - Oh, yes. Chapeau, mate. Except for this sojourn in the brig, it's utter clockwork. Go away. - What, back to the Locker? - Not without you, Jackie. Stab the heart. Live forever as captain of the Flying Dutchman. Then again... ...if you're in the brig... ...who's to stab the heart? Does seem to put immortality a bit out of reach. Peanut. We'll need to use the Black Pearl as a flagship to lead the attack. - Oh, will we now? - All right, Mrs. Fish. Come on. Barbossa, you can't release her. We need to give Jack a chance. Apologies, Your Majesty. Too long my fate has not been in me own hands. No longer. The enemy... ...has opted for oblivion. Ready the fleet. - To your stations. - To your stations. Be there some manner of rite or incantation? Aye. The items brought together, done. Items to be burned... ...and someone must speak the words: "Calypso, I release you from your human bonds." Is that it? 'Tis said it must be spoken as if to a lover. Ooh! Calypso, I release you from your human bonds! - Is that it? - No, no, no. He didn't say it right. He didn't... You have to say it right. Calypso... ...I release you from your human bonds. Tia Dalma. Tia Dalma Calypso. When the Brethren Court imprisoned you, who was it that told them how? - Who was it that betrayed you? - Name him. Davy Jones. Davy Jones This is it! This is it! Calypso! I come before you as but a servant, humble and contrite. I have fulfilled me vow and now ask your favor. Spare meself, me ship, me crew... ...but unleash your fury upon those who dare pretend themselves your masters... ...or mine. Is that it? Why, she's no help at all. What now? Nothing. Our final hope has failed us. - It's not over. - There's still a fight to be had. We've an armada against us, and with the Dutchman, there's no chance. There's only a fool's chance. Revenge won't bring your father back, Miss Swann, and it's not something I'm intending to die for. You're right. Then what shall we die for? You will listen to me. Listen! The Brethren will still be looking here to us, to the Black Pearl, to lead. And what will they see? Frightened bilge rats aboard a derelict ship? No. No, they will see free men and freedom! And what the enemy will see is the flash of our cannons. They will hear the ring of our swords, and they will know what we can do. By the sweat of our brows, and the strength of our backs... ...and the courage of our hearts. Gentlemen... ...hoist the colors. Hoist the colors. - Hoist the colors. - Hoist the colors! Aye. The wind's on our side, boys. That's all we need! Hoist the colors! We have a favorable wind, sir. Oh, so we do. Signal Jones to give no quarter. That should brighten his day. To arms! We give no quarter! Calypso. Have you noticed, on top of everything, it's raining? That's a bad sign. Man the capstan. Raise the main topyard. Keep that powder dry. Maelstrom! Captain Barbossa! We need you at the helm. Aye, that be true. Brace up yards, you cack-handed deck apes. Dying is the day worth living for. Veer off! She'll not harm us. Full-bore and into the abyss. Are you mad? Ha! You afraid to get wet? She's on our stern and gaining. More speed! Haul your wind and hold your water. Bow cannons! Blow the cannons! Take us out or they'll overbear us. Nay. Further in. We'll cut across to faster waters. Prepare to broadside. Captain the guns. Bear a hand. Muster your courage, men. At the ready. Think like the whelp. Think like the whelp. Think like the whelp. Hinges. Hinges. Think like the whelp. Half-barrel hinges. Leverage. Wish us luck, boys. We'll need it. - I miss him already. - He is quite charming, isn't he? Nobody move. I dropped me brain. Batten down the hatches! Stand to your guns. Stand to your guns. Midship cannoneers, sight the masts. Main battery at the ready! Hold there! Wait till we're board-and-board. Fire! - Fire! - Fire! Fire all! Fire! Fire! Come on, men. It be too late to alter course now, mateys. Halt there or we'll shoot. Good one. I just come to get me effects. Admirable though it may be, why are you here when you could be elsewhere? Someone has to stay and guard the chest. There's no question, there's a breakdown in military discipline on this vessel. I blame the fish people. Oh, so fish people, by dint of being fish people, automatically aren't as disciplined as non-fish people? Seems contributory, is all I'm suggesting. It's true, if there were no fish people, there'd be no need to guard the chest. And if there were no chest we wouldn't need to be here to guard it. Prepare to board! Cover! No! Lookee here, boys. A lost bird. A lost bird that never learned to fly. To my great regret. But... ...never too late to learn, eh? Whoa! The chest, hand it over. I can set you free, mate. My freedOm waS fOrfeit IOng agO. Elizabeth! Elizabeth... Will you marry me? I don't think now's the best time. Now may be the only time. I love you. I've made my choice. What's yours? Barbossa. Marry us. I'm a little busy at the moment. Barbossa, now. Fine, then. Dearly beloved, we be gathered here today... To nail your gizzards to the mast, you poxy cur. Elizabeth Swann, do you take me to be your husband? Elizabeth Swann... - I do. - Great. Will Turner, do you take me... ...to be your wife... ...in sickness and in health... ...with health being the less likely? I do. As captain, I now pronounce you... You may kiss... You may kiss... Just kiss. Leave it. You can do nothing without the key. I already have the key. No, you don't. Oh, that key. No! Oi. My pistol. Turner. Turner Fire! Thank you, Jack. Stop! It's me. It's Will. Your son. Go! Harridan! You'll see no mercy from me. That's why I brought this. I'm not going to kill you. I made you a promise. Missed. Did you forget? I'm a heartless wretch. Ah. Love. A dreadful bond. And yet, so easily severed. Tell me, William Turner, do you fear death? Do you? Heady tonic, holding life and death in the palm of one's hand. You're a cruel man, Jack Sparrow. Cruel is a matter of perspective. Is it? Will? Look at me! Stay with me! You're all right. William? My son. Will? Will? Look at me. Look at me! You will not forestall my judgment. Calypso. She's taking us down! Make quick or it's the Locker for us all! No. No, no. No! Part of the crew. Part of the ship, part of the crew. Part of the ship, part of the crew. Don't leave me. Don't. No! I won't leave you. The Dutchman must have a captain. Hold on. Thank goodness, Jack. The armada's still out there. The Endeavor's coming up hard to starboard, and I think it's time we embrace that oldest and noblest of pirate traditions. Never actually been one for tradition. Close haul her. Luff the sails and lay her in irons. Belay that, or we'll be a sitting duck. Belay that "belay that." - But the arma... - Belay. - The Endeav... - Stow. Shut it. What are they waiting for? He expects us to honor our agreement. Ready guns and gun ports. It's nothing personal, Jack. It's just good business. Ah, she survived. - Ready on the guns. - Guns ready. Full canvas. Aye, full canvas. Orders, sir. Sir! Cap'n. - Fire. - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! Fire, all! Orders? Orders, sir? Sir, what do you command? It's just... ...good business. Abandon ship! - Abandon ship! - All hands, abandon ship! They're turning away! Wind in your sails. Shiver me timbers. Captain Turner! - Mr. Gibbs. - Cap'n? - You may throw my hat if you like. - Aye, aye, cap'n. Hooray! Now go and get it. Orders, sir? You're no longer bound to the Dutchman. You're free. Aye. That's a fine thing, but... ...by my reckoning, I still have a debt that has to be paid. If you'll have me. On the wheel, then, Mr. Turner. Aye, Captain Turner. This ship has a purpose again. And where we are bound... ...she cannot come. One day ashore. Ten years at sea. That's a steep price for what's been done. Depends on the one day. Your chariot awaits, Your Highness. The oars are inside. Mrs. Turner. Goodbye, poppet. Jack. Jack It would never have worked out between us. Keep telling yourself that, darling. Once was quite enough. Thank you. I'm going to need the other one. It's nearly sunset. It's always belonged to you. Will you keep it safe? Yes. Yes. Will! Will! Keep a weather eye on the horizon. Granted it tends to list to port, and has been, on occasion, known to frighten young women. But I promise you, you will not be disappointed. Is that it? The Black Pearl? It's not very big. Love, that is a dinghy. My vessel is magnificent and fierce and huge-ish and... ...gone. Why is it gone? Is that it there? Yes, there it is. Why is it there? It's much larger up close. Jack, you promised to take us for a ride. - I was to be given the first ride. - What? You? - Not what he said. - I never! Mr. Gibbs? Any particular reason why my ship is gone? The ship? We're on the ship. Jack! The ship's gone! Really? Ladies! Will you please shut it? Listen to me. Yes, I lied to you. No, I don't love you. Of course it makes you look fat. I've never been to Brussels. It is pronounced "egregious." By the way, no, I've never actually met Pizarro, but I love his pies. And all of this pales to utter insignificance in light of the fact that my ship is once again gone. Savvy? - Take what you can. - Give nothing back. Tell me, ladies, what do you know of sea turtles? Sea turtles? Let me tell you the amazing story of Cap... All men up the ratlines. All men up the ratlines! Oh, you want a taste of this? Oh, that's a good boy! You're Daddy's boy. Oh, yes, you are. Sir? Some of the men don't feel entirely settled - about leaving Captain Jack behind. - Again. - Again. - Is that so? It would make us feel a whole lot better regarding our fortunes if we could see that item you told us about. - On the charts. - Aye. With our own eyes. To help put an ease to our burden of guilt, so to speak. Feast your eyes upon this, mateys. There's more than one way to live forever. Gents, I give you the Fountain of Youth. Sparrow. Sparrow Yo ho, yo ho A pirate's life for me We're devils and black sheep Really bad eggs DrinK up, me hearties, Yo ho Yo ho, yo ho A pirate's life for me We pillage, we plunder, We rifle and loot Drink up, me hearties Yo ho We kidnap and ravage And don't give a hoot Drink up, me hearties. Yo ho Yo ho, yo ho A pirate's life for me
Thank goodness for that, 'cause if I wasn't this would probably never work.
And that was without even a single drop of rum.”

“Mr. Gibbs: Curse you for breathin' ya slack-jawed idiot. Mother's love. Jack. You should know better than to wake a man when he's sleepin'. Its bad luck.
Fortunately, I know how to counter it; the man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink; the man who was sleeping drinks it while listening to a proposition from the man who did the waking.
Mr. Gibbs: Aye, that'll about do it.”

LikeWhether he is waxing poetic and sharing a life lesson or cracking wise and making little to no sense at all, Captain Jack Sparrow really has a way with words. With so many quotable moments, it’s hard to narrow down the Captain’s best, but we’ve taken the task upon ourselves anyway!
“This is the day you will always remember as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow.”
“I love this song! Really bad eggs!”
“I’m dishonest, and a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly. It’s the honest ones you want to watch out for, because you can never predict when they’re going to do something incredibly … stupid.”
“If you were waiting for the opportune moment, that was it.”
“Wherever we want to go, we’ll go.”
“My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.”
“Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.”
